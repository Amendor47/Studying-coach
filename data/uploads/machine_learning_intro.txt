Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

Supervised Learning: This is a type of machine learning where algorithms learn from labeled training data to make predictions on new data.

Unsupervised Learning: This involves finding hidden patterns in data without labeled examples. Common techniques include clustering and dimensionality reduction.

Deep Learning: A subset of machine learning based on artificial neural networks with representation learning. It can be supervised, semi-supervised, or unsupervised.

Key Applications:
- Image recognition and computer vision
- Natural language processing
- Recommendation systems
- Autonomous vehicles
- Medical diagnosis

Popular Algorithms:
Linear Regression: Used for predicting continuous values.
Decision Trees: Tree-like models for classification and regression.
Random Forest: An ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees.
Support Vector Machines: Effective for classification tasks with clear margins.

The field is rapidly evolving with new techniques and applications emerging constantly.
